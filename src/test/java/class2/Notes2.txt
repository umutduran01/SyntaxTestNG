Soft Assertion;
    1)Approach
        create an object of class SoftAssert
        call the assertions from this class
        once you are done making assertion use soft.assertAll();

    2)Advantage
        It will still check other assertions even one fails.

Data Provider;
    It is used for data driven testing
    Same scenario with different set of data

    A data provider must have;
    annotation,
    it must have a name,
    it must be a 2D array

    1)Approach
        use @dataProvider(name = "name") and give the data set in 2D array
        link your test case with the data provider such as @Test(dataProvide = "name")
        in parameters u are going to declare variable to hold data from data set
