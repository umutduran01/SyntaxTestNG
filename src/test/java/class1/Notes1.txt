Pom.xml:
    We place all our dependencies in this file between <dependencies> and </dependencies> tags.
    When we want to place our dependencies but pom.xml gives error, click and reload Maven.

Annotations:
    @Test: Every test case is written in this annotation.
    @BeforeMethod: Precondition that will work before every @Test.
    @AfterMethod: Post-condition that will work after every @Test.

Priority:
    We can pass priorities to test cases.
    @Test(priority=1) - It can be 1,2,3...
    By default, it is 0.

Enable and Disable:
    We can enable or disable test cases in TestNG.
    @Test(enabled = false)
    It is true by default.

Depends On:
    We can link test cases to each other so if some of them fail, the rest will not execute.
    @Test(dependsOnMethods = {"method name"})

Assertion:
    Hard Assertion:
        1) Assert.assertEquals(actual string, expected string) - It compares 2 values. If they are equal the test will pass.
        2) Assert.assertTrue(boolean) - Test will pass if boolean is true.

    In hard assertion, if one case fails, the rest will not be executed.
